This module is a simple way to apply Tinos font systemlessly. 


Tinos was designed by Steve Matteson as an innovative, refreshing sans serif design that is metrically compatible with Times New Romanâ„¢. Tinos offers improved on-screen readability characteristics and the pan-European WGL character set and solves the needs of developers looking for width-compatible fonts to address document portability across platforms.
